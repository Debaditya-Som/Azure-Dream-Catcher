I was flying over a city, feeling free and happy, but then I started falling and woke up just before hitting the ground.

I was running from a dark figure in a forest, but no matter how fast I ran, it kept getting closer.

I was at my childhood home, talking to my parents, but they were acting strangely and didn't recognize me.

I was walking through a crowded market, trying to find something, but everyone kept blocking my way.

I was swimming in an ocean, and although the water was calm, I felt overwhelmed and couldn't breathe.

I was giving a speech in front of a large audience, but suddenly I forgot what I was supposed to say and started panicking.

I was driving a car, but I couldn't control the steering wheel, and the car was swerving out of control.

I was in a dark room, and I heard voices but couldn't see anyone. I felt like something was watching me.

I was reunited with an old friend I hadn't seen in years, and we had a great time reminiscing.

I was walking through a beautiful garden full of flowers, feeling at peace and content.
